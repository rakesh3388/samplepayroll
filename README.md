Here are some recommendation that we need to consider

Code wise   

1) Exceptional handling need to be fine tune   
2) Looking at the project size we need to mantain the code like separating the code for each services   
3) Implent the security feature   
4) Proper logging of the should be implemented    

Feature

1) We can share the share salary slip to the employee via email    
2) We can add part time employee as well   
3) Make sure we have implemented the SSL   
4) Add Authentication and authorization to get the salary. Ensure that only the person who has acess can see the salary page   
5) Previous month salary slip download feature   
6) For contract employee he can check his previous earnings and work history   


Process wise

1) We should set test Environment where QA can test the features     
2) We should set up the Stage Environment and ensure the App Works in a Staging Environment    
3) Set up the monitoring system for the cloud service to make sure server is up and running all the time   
4) Regularly watch the logs    
5) We should have build rollback mechanism
